# BPM-Exercise Project

### Welcome to the Novatec BPM-Exercise Project!

We have created this repository to familiarize our internal trainees with the topic of BPM. It is divided into two
chapters: 

1. In the first chapter you will learn the basics of process modeling, specifically with BPMN 2.0.
Therefore, youÂ´re going to model a process by a given business context.


2. The second chapter deals with Camunda 7 and will give you an introduction to process automation.
The second chapter also includes to implement your previously modeled bpmn-process with Camunda7 and
Spring-Boot.

3. The third chapter deals with a first simple migration from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8 with the integeration of the 'camunda-7-adapter' community project.
